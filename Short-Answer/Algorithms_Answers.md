#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The run time for this is O(n)


b) The run time for this loop is 0(n^4) because there are multiple loops.


c) The runtime for this recursion is 0(n) because it will loop through bunnies once. There will always be a certain amount of bunnies so it's 0(n)

## Exercise II
You can use a binary search in order to solve this. We would take all the floors and add them up and divide them by 2 to get the medium. If we drop the first egg and it's not broken, then we can eliminate the floors below as not being floor 7. We would then repoeat the process for the upper floors until we find floor f when the egg gets broken. The worst case scenario would be o(log n).
